# RedditChart
Creates a widget on Reddit in the lower right hand corner which displays a pie chart showing which subreddits are most displayed on the current page.  Works on /r/all, /r/popular, user pages, and user multi's. 

Install in your browser using Greasemonkey in FireFox or Tampermonkey in Chrome.

It also creates a distinct color for each subreddit which is used in both the pie chart, and on the page itself.

The widget expands and collapses on hover, and highlights the hovered subreddit on the page.

There is a drop down in the widget which allows the user to select if they want the current page's subreddit data to be aggregated by "Sum of Votes" or by "Post Count".

Clicking the subreddit's pie chart slice will open that sub in a new tab.  

Right clicking a sub in the pie chart will hide that sub from the pie chart.  Only one sub will be hidden at a time.  To show the hidden sub, right click on the widget outside of the pie chart.
